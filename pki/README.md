PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE LAB
------------------------------

#### Intro

My name is Keith Sabine and I will be working through this SEED security lab as part of my Undergrad CS studies.

#### Some Notes
All of the machine configurations are available on the SEED website.[PKI LAB](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_PKI/). I will only be posting my progress and observations as I work through the lab and answer the questions it requires. I set up the SEED VM using the Ubuntu 20.04 VM config. I will be completing both Tasks 1 through 5.

#### Lab Environment
Download the Labsetup.zip from the [PKI LAB](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_PKI/) and run the `dcbuild` alias followed by the `dcup` to get your containers running for the lab. For this lab run the tasks on the VM, but use the container to host the apache web server. We also need to edit in a couple entries to the /etc/hosts folder on the VM.

### LAB TASKS
#### 3.1 Task 1: Becoming a Certificate Authority
