# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing


#### Intro

My name is Keith Sabine and I will be working through this SEED security lab as
part of my Undergrad CS studies. 

#### Some notes

All of the machine configurations are available on the SEED website.( https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Networking/Sniffing_Spoofing/ ). I will only be posting my progress and observations as I work through the lab and answer the questions it requires.
