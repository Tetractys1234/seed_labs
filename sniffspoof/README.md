# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing


### Intro

My name is Keith Sabine and I will be working through this SEED security lab as
part of my Undergrad CS studies. 

### Some notes

All of the machine configurations are available on the SEED website.( https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Networking/Sniffing_Spoofing/ ). I will only be posting my progress and observations as I work through the lab and answer the questions it requires. I set up the SEED VM using the Ubuntu 20.04 VM config. I will be completing both Task 1 and Task 2.


Environment Setup using Container
----------------------------------
You can download the Labsetup.zip from the Lab website which contains scripts to set up Docker Images. I have never worked with Docker before so this step has been new for me. The lab gives us some commands to build and the SEED VM setup gave us a nice bash config to make these commands easy.

Once you compose the docker images you can use the alias command given to boot up our Docker network
